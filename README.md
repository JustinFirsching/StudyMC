# StudyMC

This repository contains the source code for "StudyMC", a Minecraft plugin I
developed in Kotlin with the intent of forcing a friend to study for his
Security+ exam even while playing Minecraft.

Disclaimer: The implementation itself still needs some work, but it was
functional enough at the time and I didn't intend for this to be a long term
project. Although I am committing this on 12/10, I haven't actually touched the
codebase since 10/9. It worked when I last tested it on Minecraft 1.17.1 using
Spigot, but I have not tested it since.
